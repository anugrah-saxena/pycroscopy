What?\r\n--------------------\r\nA suite of utilities for image processing and scientific analysis of imaging modalities such as multi-frequency scanning probe microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.\r\nClasses implemented here are ported to a high performance computing platform at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).\r\n\r\n1. Why?\r\n---------------\r\nThere is that little thing called _open science_... \r\n\r\n2. Who?\r\n-----------\r\nThis project begun largely as an effort by materials scientists (_and a physicist_) at the **C**enter for **N**anophase **M**aterials **S**ciences (<https://www.ornl.gov/facility/cnms>) to implement a python library that can withstand the I/O, processing, and analysis of the gargantuan stream of images that their microscopes generate (thanks to the large CNMS users community!).\r\n\r\nBy sharing their approach and code for analyzing materials imaging we hope that it will benefit the wider community of materials science/physics (we also hope quite ardently that other materials scientists would follow suite see 1. ;-).\r\n\r\n3. The Structure\r\n-----------------\r\nThe package structure is simple, with 4 main modules:\r\n   1. _io_\r\n   2. _processing_\r\n   3. _analysis_\r\n   4. _viz_\r\n\r\nOnce a microscopy data is converted into an HDF5 format by extending some of the simple classes in _io_, the user has access to the rest of the package.\r\n\r\n(on a High Performance Computing Platform if she/he is a CNMS user!) \r\n\r\n_The PyCroscopy Team_\r\n@nlaanait, @ssomnath, @CompPhysChris, @stephenjesse and many others (@Pycroscopy/CoreDev).",
