The What and Why?\r\n--------------------\r\nA python package for image processing and scientific analysis of imaging modalities such as multi-frequency scanning probe microscopy,\r\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.\r\nClasses implemented here are ported to a high performance computing platform at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).\r\n\r\n1. The Who?\r\n-----------\r\nThis project begun largely as the effort of materials scientists and physicists at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences <https://www.ornl.gov/facility/cnms>\r\nto implement a python library for their own use and the benefit of CNMS users and hopefully the wider community of scientists that\r\ndo imaging and advanced characterization of materials.\r\n\r\n2. The Structure?\r\n-----------------\r\nThe package structure is quite simple, with 4 modules:\r\n1. io\r\n2. processing\r\n3. analysis\r\n4. viz\r\n",
