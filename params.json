  "body": "PyCroscopy\r\n==========\r\n\r\n>\"They don't think we're microscopists... Let's become pycroscopists then!\" \r\n\r\n>S.J to N.L, 2016\r\n\r\n0. What?\r\n--------------------\r\nA suite of utilities for image processing and scientific analysis of imaging modalities such as multi-frequency scanning probe microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.\r\nClasses implemented here are ported to a high performance computing platform at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).\r\n\r\n1. Why?\r\n---------------\r\nThere is that little thing called _open science_... \r\n\r\n2. Who?\r\n-----------\r\nThis project begun largely as an effort of materials scientists (_and a physicist_) at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences <https://www.ornl.gov/facility/cnms> to implement a python library that can withstand the analysis of the gargantuan stream of images that their microscopes generate; with a lot of help from for their friends: the CNMS facility users!\r\nBy sharing their approach and code for analyzing materials imaging, they hope that it will benefit the wider community of materials science/physics (and hope so ardently that others would please follow suite see 1. ;-).\r\n\r\n3. The Structure\r\n-----------------\r\nThe package structure is simple, with 4 modules:\r\n   1. _io_\r\n   2. _processing_\r\n   3. _analysis_\r\n   4. _viz_\r\n\r\nOnce a microscopy data is converted into an HDF5 format by extending some of the simple classes in _io_. The user has access to the rest of the package structure and quite possibly a lot more! \r\n(Did we mention HPC?)",
